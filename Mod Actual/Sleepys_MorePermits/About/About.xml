[h2]Sleepy's More Permits (v1.0.0)[/h2]

A simple mod that adds new permits to the game. 

While I am an experienced modder and have spent a lot of time testing and balancing this mod, I am new to Rimworld Modding so there may be unknown issues with this mod, these issues might take me longer to understand and fix while I am getting the hang of this. 
If you have any troubles, let me know in the comments below.

[b]What Does This Mod Add?[/b]
- Adds one new type of permit
- Adds two new permits (each with upgrade paths)

[b]New Permits Types[/b]
- Call Soldier Support
Allows you to call empire soldiers to a help fight for or defend your colony for a few days. You can control them just as if they were your own colonists but the support will not do most non-combat work. You are expected to keep them safe and if they die in battle you'll receive a small goodwill penalty (between -3 to -5 per death depending on the soldier type, this balances these permits from the standard military aid permits which allows them to die consequence free).

[b]New Permits[/b]
- Call Trooper Team
2 Light Troopers for 4 days

- Call Enduring Trooper Team (Prerequisite - Call Trooper Team)
2 Light Troopers for 8 days

- Call Large Trooper Team (Prerequisite - Call Trooper Team)
4 Light Troopers for 4 days

- Call Janissary Team
2 Janissaries for 4 days

- Call Enduring Janissary Team (Prerequisite - Call Janissary Team)
2 Janissaries for 8 days

- Call Large Janissary Team (Prerequisite - Call Janissary Team)
4 Janissaries for 4 days

- Call Cataphract Team (Prerequisite - Call Janissary Team)
2 Cataphracts for 4 days

[b]Roadmap:[/b]
- Add more unique, balanced and new permit types and permits (I like variety and been able to specialise your royals but I will avoid bloating the permit tab, overwhelming a player with too many options and adding repeated, basic or overpowered permits. If you have any permits you'd like to see added, let me know!
- Code in a Mod Options (So players can adjust these permits as they see fit or disable ones they do not like).
- Balancing where needed.

[b]Compatibility[/b]

[b]Saved Games:[/b]
- Safe to add to an ongoing game
- May cause issues if removed from an existing save (I'd recommend you return all permits and ensure no soldiers from these permits are on the map before removing the mod).

[b]Integrated Compatibility:[/b]

[b]Works Great With These Mods:[/b]
- Guard for Me
Makes it much easier to use the new soldier support as actual guards, patrols or to protect certain VIPs.

[b]Conflicts[/b]
Likely to conflict somewhat with other mods that add permits in the permits tab. The only real conflict is that the permit tab may become messy. I have ensured that the code for my mod will not override or conflict with any other mods.
I am adding patches to ensure my mod cleans the permit tab up if it detects these mods but I can miss new mods that come out. Let me know below if you find any conflicts with these or any mods.

[b]Known Issues[/b]
Cataphracts can sometimes spawn with single use weapons like a triple rocket or doomsday. Using this means they then can only punch enemies for the remaining time they have left which isn't very helpful. I have some ideas on how to fix this by limiting the weapons they can arrive with or letting the player tell them to pick up a replacement weapon. Regardless, this will be my top priority to fix.

[b]Language Support[/b]

[b][u]Full Support[/u][/b] (Latest Version to changed Locale: v1.0.0)
[b]English[/b] - (Developed in this language)

[b][u]FAQ[/u][/b]
[i]Will you add less than 1.3 Version Support?[/i]
If players start requesting this, I definitely will as I do know that Rimworld does a very good job with multi-version mods but I am not experienced enough to really be able to tackle it at the moment.
