[h2]Sleepy's More Permits (v1.0.0)[/h2]

A simple mod that adds new permits to the game. 

While I am an experienced modder and have spent a lot of time testing and balancing this mod, I am new to Rimworld Modding so there may be unknown issues with this mod, these issues might take me longer to understand and fix while I am getting the hang of this. 
If you have any troubles, let me know in the comments below.

[b]What Does This Mod Add?[/b]
- Adds one new type of permit
- Adds two new permits (each with upgrade paths)

[b]New Permits Types[/b]
- Call Soldier Support
Allows you to call empire soldiers to a help fight for or defend your colony for a few days. You can control them just as if they were your own colonists but the support will not do most non-combat work. You are expected to keep them safe and if they die in battle you'll receive a small goodwill penalty (between -3 to -5 per death depending on the soldier type, this balances these permits from the standard military aid permits which allows them to die consequence free).

[b]New Permits[/b]
- Call Trooper Team
2 Light Troopers for 4 days

- Call Enduring Trooper Team (Prerequisite - Call Trooper Team)
2 Light Troopers for 8 days

- Call Large Trooper Team (Prerequisite - Call Trooper Team)
4 Light Troopers for 4 days

- Call Janissary Team
2 Janissaries for 4 days

- Call Enduring Janissary Team (Prerequisite - Call Janissary Team)
2 Janissaries for 8 days

- Call Large Janissary Team (Prerequisite - Call Janissary Team)
4 Janissaries for 4 days

- Call Cataphract Team (Prerequisite - Call Janissary Team)
2 Cataphracts for 4 days

[b]Roadmap:[/b]
- Add more unique and balanced permit types and permits (I like variety and been able to specialise your royals but I will avoid bloating the permit tab, overwhelming a player with too many options and adding repeated, basic or overpowered permits. If you have any permits you'd like to see added, let me know!
- Code in a Mod Options (So players can adjust these permits as they see fit or disable ones they do not like).
- Balancing where needed.

[b]On Going Games:[/b]
- Safe to add to an ongoing game
- May cause issues if removed from an existing save (I'd recommend you return all permits and ensure no soldiers from these permits are on the map before removing the mod, you should get a one time red error saying the game couldn't find the old permits but that should be it). It is a good practice not to remove mods from an ongoing game.

[b]Compatibility[/b]
- Compatible with any other permit mods (Please report any issues with overlapping permits if you spot them and I will write a patch for it).
- My mod does not override any core content so should be compatible with any mods that change royalty, titles or permits.

[b]Integrated Compatibility:[/b]
I have made patches that cleans up the permit tab if you are using any combination of these mods. This prevents overlapping permits (which prevents you selecting the bottom one).
- [Royalty] Unlock Working Emperor (Continued)
- Unlock Emperor (Continued)
- I Demand Permits

[b]Works Great With These Mods:[/b]
- Guards for Me
Makes it much easier to use the new soldier support as actual guards, patrols or to protect certain VIPs.

[b]Conflicts[/b]
Likely to conflict somewhat with other mods that add permits in the permits tab. The only real conflict is that the permit tab may become messy. I have ensured that the code for my mod will not override or conflict with any other mods.
I am adding patches to ensure my mod cleans the permit tab up if it detects these mods but I can miss new mods that come out. Let me know below if you find any conflicts with these or any mods.

[b]Known Issues[/b]
Cataphracts can sometimes spawn with single use weapons like a triple rocket or doomsday. Using this means they then can only punch enemies for the remaining time they have left which isn't very helpful. I have some ideas on how to fix this by limiting the weapons they can arrive with or letting the player tell them to pick up a replacement weapon (you'd likely lose that weapon if you forgot to drop it later though). Regardless, this will be my top priority to fix.

[b]English[/b] - (Developed in this language)

[b]u]FAQ[/u][/b]
[i]Does it work for versions below 1.3?[/i]
I have no idea sorry as I don't use those versions, let me know if you have any issues and I'll try and fix those for you if you are running an older version of Rimworld. If it seems to work just fine, let me know too and I'll add the version tag.
