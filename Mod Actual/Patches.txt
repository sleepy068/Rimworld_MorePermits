Update v1.1.0 Build 17/04/24 Post 
*New content and adjustments, excluding bug fixes, will only be made to the Rimworld 1.5 Version of this mod (just a hassle maintaining both sorry)

Additions:
Added New Permits
- Call Alpine Rangers
- Call Desert Rangers
- Call Royal Melee Team
- Call Royal Ranged Team

Changes:
Removed Call Stellic Melee Team and Call Stellic Ranged Team patches as they've been added as in normally and renamed Royal teams (Archon Title).

Increased Title Required for Call Priority Shuttle from Knight to Praetor
Increased Title Required for Call Quick Reaction Shuttle from Knight to Praetor
Reduced Permit Cost of Call Priority Shuttle from 2 to 1 (Increased its rank to help balance it, just hard to justify the cost even for the cooldown)
Call Cataphract Team no longer has Call Janissary Team as prerequisite (Again just doesn't feel worthwhile)

Adjusted all the patches, this mod will just move other mods permits now instead of working this mod around them (way easier).

Localisation:
Updated mod description so it matches the steam description

Bug Fixes:
N/A
